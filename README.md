# Cookiecutter Open Educational Ressources with Jupyter

A [cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io) template. Creates a barebones structure to be used with a collection of jupyter notebooks that you want to make available as an [Open Educational Resource](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Educational_Resources).

The documentation is available at: **TBD...**

## Installation
Apart from a python 3 installation you also need to install cookiecuttter. You can use pip:
`pip install --user cookiecutter`
Or conda:
`conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter`
For further installation advice please refer to the [official documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.2/installation.html).

## Usage
To use the template to create your new project you have to open a terminal and navigate to the folder you want to create the project folder in. Now you can either download the template from GitHub and use it from the directory you saved it in:
`cookiecutter <your_template_folder>/cookiecutter_oer_jupyter`
Or you can tell cookiecutter to find the template on github:
`cookiecutter gh:https://github.com/spatialaudio/cookiecutter_oer_jupyter`
